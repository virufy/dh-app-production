            <p><b>The purpose of the Research Study and Overview of
                Participation </b></p>
            <p style={{ color: 'blue' }}>
                We are doing this research study to see if a special computer program,
                called Artificial Intelligence or AI, can
                help us find out if someone might have a common breathing infectious
                illness like the flu, RSV (another common
                breathing virus), or COVID-19. We want to see if this AI program can do
                this by listening to the sounds of your
                cough and your breathing, recorded on a regular smartphone.
            </p>
            <p style={{ color: 'blue' }}>
                The main idea is to collect sound recordings (like when you cough,
                breathe deeply, or make a simple sound like
                "aaaah") and some basic health information from people in the UAE. You
                are being asked because you are already
                scheduled to have a standard test for breathing illnesses at a Dubai
                Health clinic.
            </p>
            <p style={{ color: 'blue' }}>
                Your sound recordings will be used to develop, train, fine-tune, and
                test the AI computer program. We want to find
                out how well it can spot signs of these breathing illnesses just from
                the sounds you make.
            </p>
            <p style={{ color: 'blue' }}>
                If this works well, this new technology could become a quick, easy, and
                not too expensive way for people like you,
                doctors, and health officials to find breathing diseases earlier before
                they spread broadly. This could help manage
                these illnesses better in the UAE and keep our community healthier.
            </p>
            <p><b>
                What is the duration of the study? </b></p>
            <p style={{ color: 'blue' }}>Your part in this study will only
                take about 5-15 minutes of your time during
                your visit to the clinic today. This includes the time it takes for us
                to explain the study to you, for you to ask
                questions, to sign this form if you agree, to answer some health
                questions, and to make the sound recordings. The
                whole research project will involve collecting information from many
                people over several months (from around late
                August to December 2025), but you will only need to be involved in this
                one short session.

            <p style={{ color: 'blue' }}>
                <b> Why am I being invited to participate? </b>You are being invited to join
                this study because you are an adult (18 years
                old or older) and you are at a Dubai Health clinic to have a standard
                test for a breathing illness. This might be
                because you have symptoms, or because you fit into a group we are
                interested in learning more about, such as people
                who are pregnant, have a fever, or have asthma, as these can also
                involve breathing symptoms. By including
                different people, we hope to get good information to help train the AI
                program.

                You will still get your planned breathing
                test and any other care your doctor thinks you need.</p>
