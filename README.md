# üöÄ React + TypeScript App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) using the TypeScript template.


## üì¶ Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

* **Node.js** (>= 14.x recommended, check with `node -v`)
* **npm** (comes with Node, check with `npm -v`)

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd <your-project-folder>
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

‚ö†Ô∏è If you encounter a dependency conflict (common with CRA + TypeScript):

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

This will skip peer dependency strict checks and install packages correctly.

### 3. Start the development server

```bash
npm start
```

* Runs the app in **development mode**
* Opens [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) automatically in your browser


### 4. Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

* Creates a production-ready build in the `build/` folder
* Bundles React in production mode and optimizes for performance
